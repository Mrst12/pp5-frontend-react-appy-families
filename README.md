## Project Setup

1. Create a new repository in **Github** and use the 'gitpod' button at the top to create workspace
2. Create the React app by running the terminal command:
```
npx create-react-app . --template git+https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/cra-template-moments.git --use-npm
```
- enter y to confirm

3. Check the app is working by using terminal command:
```
npm start
```
4. the browser should be showing you the React logo
5. In **App.js** remove the logo import, remove the custom React header element, and replace with a 'H1' element containing a line of text such as 'hello world'.
6. Check this 'H1' is being shown in your browser preview.
7. Do a terminal command to add, commit and push the code to Github


## Components

## Deployment
### First deployment

1. In **Heroku** create a new app, give it a name and choose location.

2. In the **deploy** tab, go to 'deployment method', choose 'Github'

3. Search for the repository in Github that you want to connect and click on the connect button

4. In the 'manual deploy' section click on 'deploy branch'

5. The build log will run, when complete you will see a message saying 'build succeeded'

6. An 'Open App' button will appear, click this to take you to your deployed app.

7. You can enable automatic deploys in the 'deployment section' so each time you push your code to 'Github' your deployed app will be updated.
